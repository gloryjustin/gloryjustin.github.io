		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<p>
			Hi. My name is Glory Justin and I am a doctoral candidate, studying 
			electrical engineering, with a concentration in controls, automation 
			and power systems. I am advised by Prof. Santiago Paternain in the 
			ECSE department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I have a passion
			for renewable energy and protecting the environment, and my research 
			is on harnessing artificial intelligence methods for maintaining 
			stability in the presence of increased renewable energy resources.
